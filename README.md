### Summary

We are a pet shelter that operates on a FIFO model. We only have cats and dogs in our shelter, and only the one from each animal who has been in our shelter the longest can be adopted. Moreover, you can only adopt when it's your turn in the queue. You can start the process by clicking on the link below and adding your name to the end of the queue. You'll know when it's your turn. Happy adopting!
